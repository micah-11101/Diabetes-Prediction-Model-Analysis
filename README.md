# Diabetes Prediction Model Analysis 

We have created a neural network model to accurately predict if a patient has diabetes based on information about the patients physical health.

## The Data We Used
our data was obtained from a [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset) dataset created by user [Alex Teboul](https://www.kaggle.com/alexteboul). The data was orginally sourced from the [CDC's](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_data.htm) 2015  Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey that collects data anually.
